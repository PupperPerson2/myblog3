    <p> My favorite hobby is playing tennis. I like to practice tennis in my free time with my friends, normally after school, or in tennis camp. I am very passionate in playing tennis because it makes me happy and feel good. I plan on becoming a professional tennis player in a few years, probably when I'm done with school. Tennis is a great hobby because it is a good workout, and it lets you socialize with friends SAFELY, (for covid). This sport creates great hand eye coordination, reflex time, running speed, and sharp vision,(to tell if a fast ball is in or out). I have been playing tennis for about four years now, and I never stopped loving it!!!
